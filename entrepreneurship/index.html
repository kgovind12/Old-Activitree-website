          The Entrepreneurship Team is the magic behind the scenes of the club! This includes reaching out to both college and 
          high-school students, planning and sharing events, and organizing all the activities of Activitree! As Activitree was a 
          start-up last year, joining the Entrepreneurship Team is a good way to learn more about the different aspects of 
          businesses and organizations. The Entrepreneurship Team plans and manages Activitree’s events and shares them with 
          everyone, from socials to workshops.
