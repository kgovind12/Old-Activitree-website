      <div class = "aboutcontainer">
        <p>
          ActiviGO turns ideas into reality! We work with you on every step of your project journey, from idea to working solution. 
          We also have projects that help out organizations in our local Davis community as well. If you are looking for projects to 
          work on and help people with their ideas, we will help connect you with students who are looking for teammates as well! 
        </p>
        <p>
          We are currently opening applications for the Project Manager position. The Project Manager will be the point of contact 
          between the team and the client, and is responsible for managing the project team and its progress. Working on projects 
          requires time and dedication, and the end result as well as journey are both very rewarding. If you would like to learn 
          more about specific projects, please click the apply button on the home page, or email us at activitreeorg@gmail.com.
